This is a SMILE detection software which uses opencv ( python module ) to detect smiles and encloses them inside a green box.

Before accessing the file make sure to have opencv installed on your PC.

For this, you can either use the command

" pip install opencv-python " OR " pip install opencv-contrib-python"

in your terminal.

ENJOYY!!
